# Next Ecomm

This is an ecommerce site using Next.js 9 and the build in API to make a serverless MERN app.

This projects features:
User auth,
stripe integration,
Server side rendering,

This does have multiple user models so admins can create new stock. Not deployed as I am having issues updating correctly due to component library I am using.
